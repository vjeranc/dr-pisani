\engtitle{Learning to search for problems in natural language processing}
\begin{abstract}
Structured prediction and learning is omnipresent for problems in natural
language processing. Learning to search (\lts{}) methods provide a framework in
which these problems can be efficiently solved. In this thesis the overview of
\lts{} methods and their theoretical basis that allowed their development is
given. Their application to various problems of natural language processing is
described. Important differences that show the superiority and flexibility of
\lts{} methods are pointed out in the context of previous solutions for
structured and joint prediction. Description of the development of a system that
considers part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing as a joint task is
provided and detailed analysis of differences and advantages to various
approaches is given.
