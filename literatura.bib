  abstract =     {
    We present Searn, an algorithm for integrating search and
    learning to solve complex structured prediction problems such
    as those that occur in natural language, speech, computational
    biology, and vision.  Searn is a meta-algorithm that transforms
    these complex problems into simple classification problems to which
    any binary classifier may be applied.  Unlike current algorithms for
    structured learning that require decomposition of both the loss
    function and the feature functions over the predicted structure,
    Searn is able to learn prediction functions for any loss
    function and any class of features.  Moreover, Searn comes
    with a strong, natural theoretical guarantee: good performance on the
    derived classification problems implies good performance on the
    structured prediction problem.

  abstract = {
    We recently introduced an algorithm, Searn, for solving hard
    structured prediction problems.  This algorithm
    enjoys many nice properties: efficiency, wide applicability,
    theoretical justification and simplicity.  However, under a desire to
    fit a lot of information into the original paper,
    it may not be so clear how simple the technique is.  This report is
    designed to showcase how Searn can be applied to a wide variety of
    techniques and what really goes on behind the scenes.  We will
    make use of three example problems, ranging from simple to complex.
    These are: (1) sequence labeling, (2) parsing and (3) machine
    translation.  (These were chosen to be as widely understandable,
    especially in the NLP community, as possible.)  In the end, we will
    come back to discuss Searn for general problems.
